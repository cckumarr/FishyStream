Things to do:
1) [x] create a basic rabbitmq queue
 - [x] write to it
 - [x] read from it

2) [ ] boats write their catch to a queue

3) [ ] flink reads from the queue and filters out the unwanted

4) counts/aggregates the particular fish

5) gets the stats in the last 5 mins(maybe use windowing for this)
